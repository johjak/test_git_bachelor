## Git - documentation

### General guidelines

#### Commits

- All commit-messages in present tense
- A logfile, like the example `commit.txt`, is to be updated regulary, preferably each evening, to keep track of commits
- Every change documented in commit-messsage, sorted by file edited, as the below example


#### logfile (might be able to be automated?)
On Mac/linux:
- `git log --graph > commits.txt`


> examplefile1.vhd:
> - Edit X-statement in EXAMPLE_PROC
> 
> examplefile2.vhd:
> - Minor correction after compilation.
