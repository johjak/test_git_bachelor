#### Commits

- **Always** pull *before* making any changes to files inside the repository.
- All commit-messages in present tense.
- A **logfile**, like the example `commit.txt`, is to be updated regulary, to keep track of commits.
- Every change documented in commit-messsage, sorted by file edited, as the below example.


#### logfile (might be able to be automated?)

Command for updating the logfile (here called `commits.txt`):

- `git log --graph > commits.txt`
